Some functions use a fixed size string (e.g.: putaddr) for hex values but if the address is longer it won't work.
On systems like 42's computers memory addresses have 16 chars but on my desktop they only have 12 chars.
Implement something that will make this work on different systems.

I dont know what the difference is between the 'd' and 'i' conversions.

The way the '%' is handled is problematic as it is counted in the number of conversions so I'm not sure what the behavior is with the va_list object.
Further debugging required.
EDIT1: just did some tests with the '%' conversion and it doesn't seem to be causing problems but I'm not sure why. I would need to reread my code.
